	Our intimate and highly specialised knowledge of our market place is unmatched. Dealing substantially with Directors, Partners and Business Owners we are often able to create career opportunities for outstanding individuals with our clients before the vacancy exists. This proactive approach to talent management can only be built on a substantial foundation of knowledge, relationships and trust. Our Principals, unlike most consultants, are significant achievers in their own right.</p>

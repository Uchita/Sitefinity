<h2> About New Zealand</h2>
<p> Where do you start with New Zealand when there are so many amazing landscapes to see – the untouched beaches, the dramatic volcanic plains, or the majestic snow-capped alps?</p>
<p> New Zealand is widely recognised as having one of the highest qualities of life in the world. If you don't believe that, then you can just ask the droves of expats from all over the world that have gone for holiday only to stay forever.</p>
<p> New Zealand is divided into two islands – the North Island and the South Island. Each of these islands is divided into several regions, and each region has its own unique set of attractions and character. For more information on each of New Zealand's regions visit the New Zealand tourism website at <a href="http://www.newzealand.com/au/places/" target="_blank">http://www.newzealand.com/au/places/</a></p>
<p> On the North Island you can travel from the most northern reaches of pristine beaches that would rival any tropical postcard, down through to the city of Auckland, then to the steaming geysers and volcanic lakes in the middle, then all the way down to the delightfully cosmopolitan, and very livable, capital city of Wellington.</p>
<p> And then you have the South Island, with its rugged and wild beauty boasting scenery that simply defies description. You can find the world renowned wineries of the Marlborough region to the north and traverse all the way down through the aptly named Remarkables, along the way enjoying some of the world's most renowned and popular ski fields, and you will end up amongst a landscape so unique and beautiful that it has to be experienced in person to fully appreciate it.</p>
<p> New Zealand is a renowned destination for thrill seekers, having led the way with bungee jumping, jet boating and white water rafting for many years now. But you don't have to jump off a cliff to experience the exhilaration this country provides – just take a walk through the native bush or watch the sun dip below the horizon on a deserted beach.</p>
<p> These unique and breathtaking landscapes, along with some amazing wildlife and a pleasant temperate climate, make New Zealand a place to truly fall in love with. The culture and society is diverse, sophisticated and famously welcoming, with a high percentage of now permanent residents having made the journey from foreign shores originally themselves.</p>

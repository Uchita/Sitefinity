<h1>Talents</h1>
<p>Our methodology has been built up from working in the recruitment industry for many years, locally and overseas.  The one thing we have learned, there is no magic bullet.</p>
<p>Our approach is professional and ethical. As all recruitment should be.</p>
<p>We recognise talent wherever it may be, and in today&rsquo;s global economy it is just as likely to be in a different time zone than it is down the road.</p>
<p>Whilst a lot of recruitment is the traditional: take a role brief, source candidates and approach, assess shortlisted individuals, the interview to offer and follow up.  This method is tried and tested and it delivers results. </p>
<p>However we now find identifying key talent before a position arises is just as critical.  Engaging with you to understand your needs helps us identify employers who need your skills. </p>
<p>You may not be ready for a career change when we first talk to you. We understand our approach may even catch you off guard.  We are happy to keep talking to you until you are ready.  If not, we will still like you to be part of our network and provide you with our industry insights and news.</p>
<p>We move many individuals interstate and internationally.  As this conversation may take one week to over one year, we are not in the business of shoe-horning you into the first available role.</p>
<p>Our relationship does not stop with you after a placement. We keep in touch to ensure everything is meeting your expectations.  In many cases you will be calling us to add a member to your team in the near future.</p>

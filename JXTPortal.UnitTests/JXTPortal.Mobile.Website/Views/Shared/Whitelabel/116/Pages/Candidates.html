The mission of Pure Source Recruitment is to be the first choice in the minds of candidates for career management.</p>
<p>
This commitment is the foundation of our candidate care philosophy.</p>
<p>
Our daily dozen list, which contributes to the Pure Source Recruitment candidate care culture, includes the following candidate focussed commitments;</p>
<ul>
     <li>
     All messages from candidates are returned on the same day</li>
     <li>
     Candidate interviews must start on time, and candidates arriving early are acknowledged by the consultant, and met with earlier if possible.</li>
     <li>
     All candidate applications and enquiries are responded to</li>
     <li>
     Candidates who have been forwarded for a position and are unsuccessful (temp or perm) must be notified within 24 hours of the client advising us.</li>
     <li>
     Every candidate is treated in the exact same way you would want your mother or best friend to be treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To back this up, we give you the opportunity to rate our performance and offer us feedback.</p>
<p>
Each candidate that registers with Pure Source Recruitment will be provided with an appraisal form to complete and return to us.</p>

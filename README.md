## What is this?

There are three parts that come together to create JXT's full website template:

* Sitefinity ASP.NET MVC Application
* JXT.Widget.Common which incldues the client-specific assets (e.g. CSS and JavaScript files)
* JXT Widgets

Historically these three components resided in the same Git Repository. In order to have a more granular control on the repositories, especially to be able to control the access of the offshore teams, these three components have been seperated into three repositories.

Sitefinity includes the first component, which is Sitefinity ASP.NET MVC Application. Other two components are located in two seperate repositories.
